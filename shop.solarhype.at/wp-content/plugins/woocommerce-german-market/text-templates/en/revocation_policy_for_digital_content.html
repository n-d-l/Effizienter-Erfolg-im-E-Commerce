<strong>Notice for consumers on the cancellation of contracts for the supply of digital content not supplied on a physical medium</strong>

<em>Cancellation policy</em>
A consumer is any natural person who completes a legal transaction for purposes that are for the most part not attributable to any professional activity of either a commercial or self-employed nature they engage in.

<em>Right of cancellation</em>
You have the right to cancel this contract without giving reasons within a fourteen-day cancellation period that begins on the day on which the contract is concluded. In order to exercise your right of cancellation you must notify us ([please insert: name/company, address, telephone number and email address; you can also use the shortcode [woocommerce_de_disclaimer_address_data] and save the address in your settings]) of your decision to cancel this contract by means of an unequivocal declaration (e.g. in the form of a letter sent by post or an email). You can - but are not obliged to - use the cancellation form template appended to this cancellation policy. In order to comply with the withdrawal period, it is sufficient that you send the notification of the exercise of the right of withdrawal before the expiry of the withdrawal period.

<em>Consequences of cancellation</em>
If you cancel this contract we are required to pay back all payments we have received from you (including delivery costs but excluding additional costs incurred as a result of you selecting a different delivery option to the standard, lowest cost delivery option we offer) without delay and within a maximum period of fourteen days from the date on which we receive your correspondence notifying us of your cancellation of this contract. Repayment occurs using the same payment type you used for the original transaction unless otherwise agreed with you; under no circumstances will you be charged any fees in connection with repayment.

<em>Exclusion and premature expiry of the right of cancellation</em>
The right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts for the delivery of digital content that is not prefabricated and for the production of which an individual selection or determination by the consumer is decisive or which is clearly tailored to the personal needs of the consumer.
The right of revocation shall expire prematurely if we have only commenced performance of the contract after you have a) given your express consent thereto and at the same time confirmed your knowledge that you lose your right of revocation upon commencement of performance of the contract on our part, and b) we have provided you with the content of your declaration on a durable data medium within a reasonable period of time after conclusion of the contract, but no later than upon delivery of the goods or before performance of the service is commenced. We point out that we can make the conclusion of the contract dependent on the aforementioned consent and confirmation. The right of withdrawal shall expire prematurely if we have only begun with the execution of the contract after you have given your express consent to this and at the same time confirmed your knowledge that you shall lose your right of withdrawal with the beginning of the performance of the contract on our part. We point out that we can make the conclusion of the contract dependent on the aforementioned consent and confirmation.
